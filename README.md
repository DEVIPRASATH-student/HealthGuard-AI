🔹 Project Title

HealthGuard AI – Intelligent Multi-Disease Prediction System

🔹 Detailed Project Description 

HealthGuard AI is an intelligent healthcare support system designed to assist in early disease detection using machine learning techniques. The system focuses on predicting three major diseases—Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease—based on clinical and physiological parameters provided by the user.

The project uses publicly available medical datasets and applies data preprocessing techniques such as missing value handling, feature encoding, and normalization. Separate machine learning models are trained for each disease using Logistic Regression due to its interpretability and effectiveness in medical decision-making. The trained models are saved and reused for real-time predictions.

A user-friendly web interface is developed using Streamlit, allowing users to select a disease, enter patient health parameters, and instantly receive prediction results. HealthGuard AI runs locally and can also be deployed on cloud platforms such as Streamlit Community Cloud using GitHub integration.

The system demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in healthcare and highlights how AI can support early diagnosis and decision-making, while not replacing professional medical advice.
